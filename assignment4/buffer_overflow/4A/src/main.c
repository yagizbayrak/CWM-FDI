// In this program, there are a few important functions.
// Consider victim as a utility function that exists in some large codebase somewhere, that someone built
// without considering it's security implications. 
// This victim function accepts a str pointer, and copies the content of this str pointer
// to a local buffer that has a fixed value of 16 characters. 
// The first question you should ask is, what happens if your input string is more than 16 bytes?
// The answer is, strcpy is a function that continues copying this until it encounters a null character.
// That is, it does not stop when the buffer is full. Instead, it continues incrementing the addresses
// of both, the buffer and str as it iterates over the input string, OVERWRITING ANYTHING IN ITS PATH!

// What happens if the return address is in the path of this buffer pointer?
// Well, it will be overwritten with whatever the string contains.
// So when the function returns, you will jump to whatever you wrote to the address of the return pointer
// This means you can controll where the user returns by controling the input to this function!

// OUR GOAL: make victim return to steal password instead of main!    <--- Your objective!

// Steal password is a function that lives in the same program as the victim function (obviously). 
// Naturally, code that you may be attacking will not convinently have malicous functions that 
// leak critical information of the program, but we just make this assumption for now.
// Exercise 2 demonstrates that there are many ways around this assumption,
// including executing shell code, return-oriented-programing, and others. 
// In any case, consider steal function as code you want to execute, but will never actually run
// unless you trick the program into doing so.
